# 1.0.0 Release
This is the first `ServerAPI` **stable** release you can enjoy!

Added features:
- installation wizard
- launching rust modules in parallel
- config support (you can change everything manually)
- implemented fancy html header (use of `maud` crate)
- implemented a text raw alternative to html in case client does not support it


Waited soon:
- crate organization, such as in my [`LimitPush`](https://github.com/heydocode/limitpush) project
- launching of processes via the CLI environment
- responsible CLI with commands
- inter-operability with [`LimitPush`](https://github.com/heydocode/limitpush) template, and any other bevy game
- feature organization
- custom multiplayer protocol that'll work with `LimitPush` if "mp-protocol" feature enabled
